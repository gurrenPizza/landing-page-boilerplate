# 'Lembre' app

This page intends to be used as a marketing thing for Lembre app and also be a place to download it's apk file.

Lembre is an Android flash cards app built using Android Studio and Firebase as its database. It was built as a final exam project for IFRJ's Informatics Technician formation integrated to Highschool. (https://github.com/gurrenPizza/LembreApp)
